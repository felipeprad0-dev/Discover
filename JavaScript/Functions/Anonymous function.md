# Anonymous function

    Anonymous function is a type of function that there is no name. So, it needs to be declared within a variable.

    Example

    const sum = function () {
        console.log(1 + 1)
    }


## Execute / run / call / invoke    

    To execute a anonymous function, we just have to write the variable name, followed by parentheses.

    sum();
