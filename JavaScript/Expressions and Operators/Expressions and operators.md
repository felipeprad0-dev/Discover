# Expressions and Operators 


## Expressions

_Is any valid set of literals, variables, operators and expressions that evaluate a single value. All expressions in JavaScript may or may not end with `;`_

Example:

let number; 

or let number = 1;


## Operators 

_Unary_
These operators are the simplest in JavaScript.
The Unary Operators works in an operand.
`Typeof` and `delete` are Unary operators too.

` + `     ---->       Unary Plus      ---->       Converts an operand to a number
` - `     ---->       Unary Minus     ---->       Converts an operand to a number and negates the value after it

` ++ `    ---->       Prefix and suffix increment       ---->  Adds one to the operand
` -- `    ---->       Prefix and suffix decrement       ---->  Subtracts one from the operand   


_Binary_
Needs two values for the arithmetic operators to be between it.
Example:

console.log(`number + 1`);


_Ternary_
This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the `if` statement.

`condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`
