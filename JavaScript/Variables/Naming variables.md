# Naming Variables 

    * JavaScript is case-sensitive, that is, uppercase and lowercase make difference
    * JavaScript allows the Unicodes characters

## We can: 
        - Start with these two special characters: $ _
        - Start with letters 
        - Put accents 
        - Uppercase and Lowercase make difference

## We can not:
        - Start with numbers 
        - Put empty spaces in the name 

## Ideal
        - Create names that makes sense
        - That explain what a variable is or what it does
        - camelCase (thisVariableDoesThis)
        - snake_case (this_variable_does_this)
        - Declare in English
