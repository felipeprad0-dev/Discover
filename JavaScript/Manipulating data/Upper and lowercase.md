_Use the `.toUpperCase()` and `.toLowerCase()` methods._


## Transforming everything into Uppercase

```JS

let word = "Programming is very good!";

console.log(word.toUpperCase())     ----->      PROGRAMMING IS VERY GOOD!

```


## Transforming everything into Lowercase

```JS

let word = "PROGRAMMING IS VERY GOOD!";

console.log(word.toLowerCase())     ----->      programming is very good!
