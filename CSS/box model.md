# Box Model

* CSS works with the box ideas
* You will realize that (almost) everything are boxes in CSS 
* Placements, sizes, spacing, borders, colors
* Boxes can be next to each other, or above and below 
* HTML elements are boxes

```HTML

<h1>Evolve Fast</h1>
<p>Description</p>
<button>To Board</button>

```

```CSS 

h1 {
    border: 1px solid red;
    margin: 200px;
    padding: 60px;
}

```
