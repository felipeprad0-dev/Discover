# What is Programming? 

    * Algorithms
        - Steps to solve problems
        - Logical sequence

    * Logic Programming
        - Construction of algorithms
        - Application of steps


# How does the computer think? 

    * No! Who thinks is the developer
    * It only calculates and processes
    * Only take orders that the developer sends through a programming language
    * The developer just needs to understand about the problem and give the orders


# Give Instructions

    * Datas
        Types: 
            - String
            - Numeric
            - Boolean
    * Data manipulation


# Solve Problems 

    * The key of the programming is to understand the problem
    * Can't continue if don't understand the problem

# How the Web Works? 

    Simple way ----------------------------- Do you wanna access a website? So, open your broswer! ----------------------------- Advanced way


    Simples Way
        - Type the site: rocketseat.com.br
        - See the Rocketseat Website


    Advanced Way
        * Type the URL: https://rocketseat.com.br
            * HTTP
                - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                - Its function is exchange messages between computers
                - The messages is divided into several parts (chunks)
            * URL
                - Uniform Resource Locator
                - Resource Locator and identificator 
                - Resource, in this case, is the website
        * Through the TCP Protocol, a communication line is started between the computer (Client) until the page's computer (Server)
            * Client
                - Computer, device or application that made the request
                - Browser
            * Server
                - Computer that has been was configured to receive requests and send the response to requests
            * TCP
                - Transmission Control Protocol
                - Its function is to ensure that the packages arrives correctly at the destination 
        * Through the DNS, the Address is converted to an IP (00.00.00.00)
            * IP
                - Internet Protocol
                - Its function is addressing of computers
            * DNS
                - Domain Name Servers
                - Its function is to convert a domain into an IP address 
        * The order is going through several proxies
            * Proxy
                - Any device in the way
                - Modem, router, other computers
                - Its function is to forward packages
        * Your order reaches the server
        * The server analyzes the request and returns a response, in this case, a positive response.
        * The way back is similar to the one way, passing through the communication line created.
        * The browser receives the commands and assembles the site screen.
        * This process happens many times, because for each resource (html, css, javascript, image), a new connection is made.
