# HEAD 
    It works like a "pointer", demonstrating what point in history we are, like the branch and the commit. 
    We can move between the commits and branches.



                       HEAD
                        ↓
    master          6fd78a0cf   
   (branch)






                                           HEAD
                                            ↓
